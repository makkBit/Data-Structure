# Queue

1. Priority queue is like a regular queue, but where additionally each element has a "priority" associated with it. In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority. If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue.

2. Used in 
  * CPU scheduling
  * Graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm, Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree
  * All queue applications where priority is involved
